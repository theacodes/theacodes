### :wave: Hi there, I'm Stargirl (also, sometimes, Thea)

I am an open source advocate and a highly experienced developer relations engineer.

I'm the owner of [Winterbloom](https://winterbloom.com), an independent, woman-owned synthesizer company that creates open-source [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) modules.

I write articles about Python, developer relations, hardware design, and firmware development at [blog.thea.codes](https://blog.thea.codes).

I'm currently working on the Flutter developer relations team Google.

You can find out more about me at [thea.codes](https://thea.codes)

You can see what equipment I use at [thea.codes/stuff.html](https://thea.codes/stuff.html)

I have my own color scheme for text editors called [Witch Hazel](https://witchhazel.thea.codes)

You can tip me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/theacodes), or sponsor me through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/theacodes)

Fun fact- I love weasels.
