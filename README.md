### :wave: Hi there, I'm Thea Flowers!

I'm a creative technologist and open source advocate. It's my mission in life to empower creativity through hardware, software, writing, and music.

I'm currently working on open source manufacturing at [Opulo]. I'm also serving on the [OSHWA] board, cooking up [KiCanvas], and I used to make open source synthesizers as [Winterbloom].

You can find out more about me at [thea.codes] and [thea.codes/stuff.html]

I write articles about Python, developer relations, hardware design, and firmware development at [blog.thea.codes].

You can see what equipment I use at [thea.codes/tools.html]

I have my own color scheme for text editors and more called [Witch Hazel].

You can tip me on [Ko-fi], or sponsor me through [GitHub Sponsors].

Fun fact- I love weasels.
